# Problem statement:
Atliq needs help keeping track of when employees are present or absent, and how often they work from home. This information is crucial for planning company events and finding ways to save money. Right now, Atliq doesn't have a good way to collect and analyze this data, which makes it hard to make smart decisions about scheduling and cost-cutting. To solve this problem, Atliq is looking for a simple and effective HR analysis solution that can tell them when employees are at work, when they're not, and how often they work from home, so they can plan better and save money.
# Solution:
Atliq can deploy a comprehensive data analytics solution to address HR challenges. By calculating attendance percentages, sick leave percentages, sick leave counts, work from home (WFH) percentage counts, present days, and office working days for each employee, Atliq can gain a deeper understanding of their workforce dynamics. This data-driven approach enables better resource allocation, event planning, and cost-cutting strategies. Leveraging these insights, the company can optimize schedules, incentivize attendance, and improve WFH policies. The result is enhanced operational efficiency, reduced absenteeism, and cost savings, ensuring Atliq can make informed decisions to achieve its objectives in a more streamlined and cost-effective manner.


# Steps Followed in this project
The HR analysis dashboard using Power BI and Excel empowers the HR department at Atliq to make data-driven decisions, optimize workforce management, and facilitate effective program planning based on employee presence, work arrangements, and leave patterns.















The HR analysis dashboard that I created for Atliq using Power BI and Excel provides valuable insights into employee presence in the office, as well as their work from home and leave patterns. The dashboard also assists the HR department in organizing various programs and events effectively.

The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of employee attendance and tracks their presence in the office. It provides real-time data on the number of employees present, absent, or working remotely. This information enables the HR team to monitor attendance trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions regarding workforce management.

Furthermore, the dashboard tracks work from home arrangements, allowing HR to assess the frequency and duration of remote work for each employee. This data helps in evaluating the effectiveness of remote work policies and understanding the impact on productivity and employee satisfaction.

The leave management feature of the dashboard provides a centralized view of employee leave requests, approvals, and balances. HR can easily track the availability of employees and plan programs or events accordingly. By having a clear overview of leave patterns, the HR department can effectively manage employee absences, ensure sufficient staffing, and minimize disruptions to daily operations.

In addition to attendance and leave management, the HR analysis dashboard offers insights into employee engagement and satisfaction. By integrating survey data or feedback mechanisms, the dashboard can provide valuable metrics and visualizations to help HR assess employee sentiment and identify areas for improvement.

Overall, the HR analysis dashboard using Power BI and Excel empowers the HR department at Atliq to make data-driven decisions, optimize workforce management, and facilitate effective program planning based on employee presence, work arrangements, and leave patterns.
